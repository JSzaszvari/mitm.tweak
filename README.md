# iOS mitm.tweak

Dump all requests to server into a `dump` folder you can access through iTunes.  

To view those dump, you can use https://github.com/pogosandbox/node-pogo-mitm.  
To do so, put all dump into a `ios.dump` folder and run `./import/ios.dump.js`, then use the embed ui to view requests.
